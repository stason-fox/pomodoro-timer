# Pomodoro Timer

#### Description: Pomodoro timer. Tools used: React, CSS, HTML.

I designed a Pomodoro timer that has adjustable session and break lengths and an alarm that goes off when the time reaches 0. It also has a play/pause button, a reset button, and up and down buttons for increasing and decreasing time. The Pomodoro technique supposedly works, so it might be worth giving it a shot.
